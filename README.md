# BookSky

I have created this project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it's deployed on GitPages. You can check it out [here](https://rallycode.github.io/bookManager/).

## About

BookSky is a simple web page where users can share their views about a book. The user can add a review with details such as the book title, author's name, and their thoughts on the book. Additionally, users have the option to delete their reviews. 

Please note that this is currently a front-end project, and there is no backend to store the review records. However, I am considering adding backend functionality in the future.

Feel free to explore the [BookSky project](https://rallycode.github.io/bookManager/)!
